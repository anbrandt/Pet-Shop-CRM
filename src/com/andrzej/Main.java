/*

this class is a final interface of the program.
Here we execute daily tasks:
- get the number of the all managers and print their names
- get the number of the all salesman and print their names
- get the number of all cats and print their age and price
- get the number of all lizards and print their price


Than we execute the selling:
Customer comes in and buys the product. Each sale has to contain several informations:
- which product is being sold. Is it cat or the lizard? (remove from the magazine, add to saled array list)
- which salesman or manager did the sale (save their name or unique id)


Perform the selling repeatedly with different managers and salemans.

At the end of the day:
- print the names of the all employees and managers and print their earnings. Sort them by name and by earnings
- print all the left animals in the shop
- print all the sold animals in the shop
